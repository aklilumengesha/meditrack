# Healthcare Backend API

**Note:** For an overview of the entire project, including overall architecture, features, and a list of all technologies used, please see the main [README.md](../README.md) in the root directory.

This project is a healthcare backend application built with NestJS. It provides RESTful API services for managing patients, medical records, and appointments. The application is structured to ensure modularity and scalability, with each major domain (Appointment, Medical Record, Patient) having its own module, controller, and service.

## Description of the structure
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: Defines the data model for the application using Prisma ORM, which simplifies database interactions.

- `src/appointment/`: Contains files for the `Appointment` module, including :
  - `appointment.controller.ts` (API endpoints)
  - `appointment.module.ts` (module setup)
  - `appointment.service.ts` (business logic for appointments)

- `src/medical-record/`: Contains files for the Medical Record module, including :
  - `medical-record.controller.ts` (API endpoints)
  - `medical-record.module.ts` (module setup)
  - `medical-record.service.ts` (business logic for medical records)

- `src/patient/`: Contains files for the Patient module, including : 
  - `patient.controller.ts` (API endpoints) 
  - `patient.module.ts` (module setup), 
  - `patient.service.ts` (business logic for patients).

- `app.module.ts`: The root module of the application that imports and sets up the other modules.

- `main.ts`: The entry point of the application, where the NestJS framework is initialized and the server is started.
